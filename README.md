Storing various files as I learn to code from websites with coding problems.

  Code Abbey problems can be found at: www.codeabbey.com

  reddit code challenge contains challenges found on r/dailyprogrammer

  Random Coding Ex. contains more full fledged code that I am working on or things that I can showcase as I develop my ability to program.


Basically, this repo is all about me learning to code my way out of a paper bag.
